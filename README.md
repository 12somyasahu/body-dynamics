# Body Dynamics

Body Dynamics is a real-time human motion analysis web app that uses computer vision and physics-based modeling to analyze body movement from live camera input.

The project is designed to be sport-agnostic and camera-agnostic, focusing on accurate kinematics, balance, and center-of-mass dynamics through a full-stack web architecture.
